# Test vectors

## Proofs from one circuit

We include several test vectors that do zero knowledge proofs from a single circuit.

[`draft-google-cfrg-libzk-00`][draft-google-cfrg-libzk] contains a test vector for a serialized
circuit, but it does not appear to correspond to either the structure definitions in that same
document, or to the circuit serialization implementation in
[`longfellow-zk/lib/proto/circuit.h`][longfellow-circuit-proto].

Presumably the test vector was generated from some intermediate version of longfellow-zk, but
there's not much to be done with it.

The test vector format is a JSON document describing the test vector. Alongside it are files
containing:

- `<test-vector>.circuit.zst`: the zstd compressed serialization of the circuit. Circuits are
  compressed using `zstd(1)` with default options:

```sh
> zstd --version
*** Zstandard CLI (64-bit) v1.5.7, by Yann Collet ***
> zstd /path/to/uncompressed/circuit test-vectors/circuit/circuit-name.circuit.zst
```

- `<test-vector>.sumcheck-proof`: the serialization of the padded sumcheck proof of the evaluation
  of the circuit. These are not compressed since proofs are padded with random values and thus don't
  compress efficiently. Not every test vector includes a sumcheck proof.

- `<test-vector>.ligero-proof`: the serialization of the Ligero proof. Much like sumcheck proofs,
  they don't compress particularly well. Not every test vector includes a Ligero proof.

### `longfellow-rfc-1-87474f308020535e57a778a82394a14106f8be5b-1`

This test vector was generated using [this branch][rfc-1-test-vector-constraints] of longfellow-zk.

Run the `Rfc_testvector1` test:

```sh
make -j 16 && ctest -j 16 -R ZK.Rfc_testvector1
```

The output in `LastTest.log` will include the serialized circuit, Ligero commitment, Ligero proof,
sumcheck proof and Ligero constraints.

### `longfellow-mac-circuit-66aeaf09a9cc98e36873e868307ac07279d5f7e0-1`

This test vector was generated using [`longfellow-zk/lib/circuits/mac/mac_circuit_test.cc`][mac-test-vector-1]
at commit 66aeaf09a9cc98e36873e868307ac07279d5f7e0 and the serializations for circuits, layers and
quads at that version.

## `mdoc_zk`

### `v6_1attr_issue_date`

This test vector was generated using a custom test from commit
[a766c1c2ef1af6b45b686180b9436e88545d4d21][commit-a766c1c]. The two files provide a serialized proof, along
with the DeviceResponse, the SessionTranscript, the requested attributes, and the time that were
used to generate it.

[commit-a766c1c]: https://github.com/divergentdave/longfellow-zk/commit/a766c1c2ef1af6b45b686180b9436e88545d4d21

### `v7_1attr_issue_date`

This test vector was generated using a custom test from commit
[2c081d6a1772a5dc29e4de9e044bfac6c08b654e][commit-2c081d6]. It provides a serialized proof. The
DeviceResponse, the SessionTranscript, the requested attributes, and the time are unchanged from the
above test vector for circuit version 6, so the corresponding file is shared between tests.

## `bind`

These test vectors exercise binding over sumcheck arrays consisting of elements from various fields.

The `dense_1d_array_bind_*.json` test vectors exercise binding a single element to a 1D dense array.

The `sparse_2d_array_bind_*.json` test vectors exercise binding a single element to alternating
hand dimensions of a 2D sparse array.

The `sparse_3d_array_bind_*.json` test vectors exercise binding an array of elements to the gate
dimension of a 3D sparse array.

They were generated using tests defined in `sumcheck::bind::test_vector.rs`. To regenerate test
vector JSON and overwrite what's currently checked out, run the `sumcheck::bind::test_vector::tests`
tests with the environment variable `ZK_CRED_LONGFELLOW_WRITE_TEST_VECTOR_FILES=1`.

```sh
ZK_CRED_LONGFELLOW_WRITE_TEST_VECTOR_FILES=1 cargo test sumcheck::bind::test_vector::tests
```

Doing this may cause failures in the tests that check consistency between the checked-in test
vectors and the generator.

When run without the environment variable, the tests will print the generated test vector to stdout.
Run the test with `--no-capture` to observe the JSON test vector.

Test vectors contain the RNG seed used to generate them, making it possible to re-generate them
deterministically. Just set the `seed` variable in test functions
`generate_1d_dense_array_bind_test_vector`, `generate_2d_sparse_array_bind_test_vector`, and
`generate_3d_sparse_array_bind_gate_vector`.
